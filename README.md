# Shinobi Duel

One sword duel in a browser tab: a kunoichi against a samurai general on a snowy castle rooftop at
dusk, fought the way Sekiro fights. You win by deflecting his blade until his posture breaks, not by
whittling down a health bar, and then you drive the deathblow home. He gets up once, angrier.

**Play it: https://starknightt.github.io/shinobi-duel/** — desktop Chrome or Edge, keyboard and
mouse. Any key on the title starts the fight; that key also starts the sound.

It was built and measured on an RTX 4060 and wants a desktop GPU. The download is about 22 MB (the
arena is 13 MB of it) and it streams in behind the title screen.

## Running it locally

**pnpm, not npm.** The lockfile is pnpm's.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarKnightt/shinobi-duel.git
cd shinobi-duel
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5411
pnpm build      # strict type-check, then a production build into dist/
pnpm preview    # serve dist/ on http://localhost:5410
```

The build uses a relative base, so `dist/` works from any static host or sub-path; every push to
`main` deploys it to GitHub Pages through `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (built with
`GITHUB_PAGES=1`, which sets the base to `/shinobi-duel/`). `vercel.json` covers Vercel.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| W A S D | Move, relative to the camera, locked on or free |
| Left mouse (J) | Attack. Hold it and the light cut flows into a charged cut that drives through his guard |
| Right mouse (K, L) | Guard. Tap it just before a blow lands to deflect |
| Shift | Step dodge; hold to sprint. Step into a thrust to mikiri it |
| Space | Jump. Jump again at him to kick off his head; attack in the air for an air cut |
| R | Drink from the healing gourd |
| Middle mouse / Q / Tab | Lock on, or unlock and re-centre the camera behind her |
| M | Mute (remembered) |
| Enter / E / Space / click | Confirm on the title and end screens; Esc / Backspace goes back |

The title shows the same list in ink. Nothing else is on screen outside the fight HUD.

| URL option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `chars=procedural` | Use the code-built fighters instead of the Mixamo bodies |
| `debug=anim` | In-game clip inspector: scrub clips, see their event bands, copy the events |
| `audio=off` | No sound at all (for A/B performance runs) |

## The fight

- **Deflect, posture, deathblow.** A tap of the guard inside 0.25 s of the blow deflects it: sparks,
  a ringing clang and a chunk of his posture, more for each deflect in a chain. Holding the guard
  only blocks, and that wears down your own posture. When his bar fills he staggers and the red
  deathblow mark appears; you have four seconds to take it. Mashing the guard narrows the window
  step by step, so rhythm beats panic.
- **Two phases.** The first deathblow sends him to one knee, and he rises with a battle cry for
  phase two: faster, shorter pauses, new strings (a flurry, leap follow-ups, a combo that ends in a
  grab). The second deathblow is the finisher, played as a letterboxed cinematic.
- **Resurrection.** Die once and you can rise on the spot at half vitality; he keeps the damage you
  did. Die again and it is over.
- **Healing gourd.** Three swallows, 45 % each, not refilled by resurrection. He sees you drink and
  punishes it: point blank at once, from range after a beat.
- **Three perilous attacks.** A red 危 flashes over her head before each. The *thrust* can't be
  guarded; deflect it, sidestep it, or step into it for a **mikiri counter** that stamps his blade
  into the roof. The *sweep* has to be jumped (and a second jump kicks off his head for heavy
  posture). The *grab* can only be dodged or jumped, and leaves him open.
- **Lock-on.** The camera frames both fighters; unlocking re-centres it behind her. The guard turns
  to face him within eight metres either way.
- **Fair, and tested for it.** A simulated "learner" who is 55 ms off on every reaction and misses
  one blow in eight wins on the first or second try; a masher who spams attack and guard loses five
  times out of five.

## What is in it

- **Arena built in Blender.** The rooftop, the two keeps, the turrets, the lanterns and the snow
  drifts were modelled in Blender 5.1 through the Blender MCP from Python scripts in
  `tools/blender/`, textured with Poly Haven CC0 scans, ambient occlusion baked in Cycles, and packed
  with glTF-Transform into one 13 MB GLB (WebP textures, meshopt geometry). The sky, mountains, mist
  and sun are shaders in code, lit to a low Sekiro-style dusk: a huge hazy sun behind the general,
  warm rims, cold blue shadows and a painterly grade.
- **Mixamo characters.** The kunoichi is Mixamo's Kachujin and the general is Paladin in a
  procedural horned kabuto, menpō, sode and cape. 85 Mixamo clips were converted headless in
  Blender to two 3 MB GLBs. The combat runs on a hidden procedural reference rig whose timings the
  fight was tuned on; each Mixamo clip is time-warped to land its wind-up, contact and recovery on
  those times, and inside hit windows an IK layer steers the real blade onto the reference blade, so
  sparks sit on both swords.
- **Synthesized audio.** There are no sound files. Every clang, footstep, kiai, gust, temple bell
  and the adaptive taiko and shakuhachi score is generated with the Web Audio API: Karplus-Strong
  shamisen and koto strings, formant voices, a generated rooftop reverb, ducking, and a limiter
  chain so nothing clips however many hits land at once.
- **Ink UI.** The 雪刃 title, the HUD and the end screens are brush lettering drawn in code from
  system fonts (smeared, bristle-streaked, thresholded back into dry-brush ink). No web fonts, no
  image files.

## Tools

Every tool drives the real game in a GPU-backed headless Chromium (`tools/gpu.mjs` refuses to run on
a software rasterizer). They need `pnpm dev` running (port 5411); `DUEL_URL` points them at any
other build, e.g. `DUEL_URL=http://localhost:5410/ node tools/bot.mjs`, and `DUEL_VIEW=960x540`
shrinks the viewport.

| Tool | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `node tools/bot.mjs` | Real-time playtest: title, a key, both phases. Passes only with ≥6 deflects, a mikiri, a jumped sweep, exactly one heal, two deathblows, VICTORY and zero errors |
| `node tools/mech.mjs` | 51 deterministic mechanics checks: input, movement, camera, the deflect window and anti-mash, mikiri, sweep and kick, grab, gourd and punish, deathblows, regen tables, cancels, death flow |
| `node tools/combat.mjs` | 19 sword-fight glitch repros, one per bug fixed in the combat pass (floating sparks, blades through bodies, lunges overshooting…) |
| `node tools/deathloop.mjs` | Real keyboard and mouse events through three rounds of die, resurrect, die, defeat and restart |
| `node tools/fairness.mjs` | Simulated players: a frame-perfect bot, a learner, a casual player and a masher |
| `node tools/soak.mjs [secs]` | Five bot fights back to back, random-input fuzz, resource growth, hitches, tab switches, resizes |
| `node tools/perf.mjs` | Frame rate and first-use shader compiles |
| `node tools/shoot.mjs`, `tools/og.mjs` | Screenshots of named set pieces; `og.mjs` renders the images in this README |
| `node tools/audio-render.mjs` | Renders ~50 sounds offline through the real mix; fails on clipping, NaN or silence |

`window.__duel` exposes the hooks they use: `game` (pause, step, startFight, forceBossAttack,
place…), `rules` (the tuned constants) and `scene(name)` for deterministic set pieces.

## Performance

200 fps (the headless cap) at 1600×900 on an RTX 4060, with the Mixamo bodies, full post chain
(N8AO, bloom, god rays, grade), 4096² sun shadows and 13 lantern lights; 92-98 fps at 2560×1440.
`bot.mjs` fights hold 144-200 fps, and the 120-second soak has no combat frame over 20 ms. Every
shader, the hidden combat effects included, is compiled behind the title so the first deflect
never stalls. The production build reaches `__duel.ready` in about 7 s from a local server.
