/**
 * The duel: owns the renderer, world, fighters, camera, HUD and audio, runs the fixed-step
 * simulation and resolves combat.
 *
 * Deflect rule (gameplay seconds, measured at the moment the general's swept blade first
 * touches the player's capsule):
 *   guard pressed in [contact - window, contact]                   → perfect deflect
 *   no press yet → held pending for DIFFICULTY.deflectLate; a press in time  → perfect deflect (late)
 *   guard held but pressed earlier than the window                 → regular block
 *   otherwise                                                      → hit
 * `window` is 0.2 s, shrunk by Input's anti-mash rule (never below 0.1 s).
 *
 * Perilous attacks (the red glyph): a thrust can't be blocked but can be deflected, sidestepped
 * (i-frames) or countered with the mikiri (a step dodge toward him); a sweep hits anything on
 * the roof in reach (jump it, kick off his head); a grab ignores guard (dodge or jump it).
 *
 * Lives: the player has one resurrection per fight (the gourd is not refilled by it). The
 * general has two deathblow markers: the first deathblow takes one and he rises for phase 2
 * at full vitality; the last is the finisher and VICTORY.
 *
 * Contact: the swept blade is tested in sub-steps, so the first touch is known to a few cm.
 * The attacker is re-posed to that instant and its animation is held (gameplay time keeps
 * running) until the outcome is known and the hitstop is over; a guarding defender brings its
 * blade through the touch point, sparks spawn exactly there, and a stopped swing rebounds
 * instead of following through the defender's body.
