 *
 * Offsets are metres in the bone's frame after the model is scaled to `height`; rotations are
 * XYZ Euler radians. Tuned for Kachujin G Rosales (player) and Paladin J Nordstrom (boss); check
 * other characters in `?debug=anim` / tools/charshot.mjs. `fit` / `speed` only matter for moves the
 * procedural rig has no timeline for (the rest are time-warped onto the gameplay clock).
